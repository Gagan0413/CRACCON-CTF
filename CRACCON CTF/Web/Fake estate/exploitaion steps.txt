 You have to pass this request in burp : 


GET /houseDoor HTTP/1.1
Host: craccon.ctf.defhawk.com:3000
x-middleware-subrequest: src/middleware


This command is basically an HTTP request to open the /houseDoor page on the server.
The special part is the header:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  x-middleware-subrequest: src/middleware  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Normally, this header is added inside the server automatically when Next.js (the framework) passes a request through its middleware. 
It’s like a tag that says “this request came from inside the house”.

But here, we are adding that header manually.
By doing this, we are pretending to be an internal request. Sometimes servers trust these internal requests more, 
so this trick can be used to bypass checks or open hidden routes.
